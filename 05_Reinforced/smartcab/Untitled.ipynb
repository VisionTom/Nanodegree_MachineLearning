    "**Task:**\n",
    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "•\tThe next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "•\tThe state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "•\tThe current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (None, 'forward', 'left', 'right') at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, enforce_deadline to False and observe how it performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION:** Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does thesmartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?\n",

    "**Anwser:** I implemented a random action generator:"

    "Now that your driving agent is capable of moving around in the environment, your next task is to identify a set of states that are appropriate for modeling the smartcab and environment. The main source of state variables are the current inputs at the intersection, but not all may require representation. You may choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the self.state variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcementenforce_deadline being set to False, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses.\n"
