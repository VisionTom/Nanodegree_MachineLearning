In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**1) GaussianNB**: \n",
    "**Real world application:** Spam (http://www.ijcse.com/docs/IJCSE11-02-01-003.pdf)\n",
    "**Strengths & Weaknesses:** \"The weaknesses, but also some surprising strengths, come from the “Naive” part of Gaussian Naive Bayes. The naive aspect of the algorithm is that it treats all of the input dimensions as independent from each other. Another way of saying this is as follows: even if there is covariance between two or more input dimensions, the GNB classifier does not model it.\" (source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724912/)\n",
    "**Good candidate, because:** It could be a good candidate, because it generalizes well and is pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: \n",
    "**Real world application:** Very often used for binary decisions (for example bank scoring): https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-typical-use-cases-for-different-machine-learning-algorithms\n",
    "**Strengths & Weaknesses:** \"SVMs have the advantage (compared to decision trees) that you can use them for non-linear decision boundaries. But the disadvantage is that you can't attribute meaning (like why the features being x result in the sample being classified y). SVMs also take a really long time to train.\" source ( https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-typical-use-cases-for-different-machine-learning-algorithms)\n",
    "**Good candidate, because:** It is very powerful with few training data, it is good for binary decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) AdaBoostClassifier**: \n",
    "**Real world application:** for example face detection: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/talks/nips-tutorial.pdf\n",
    "**Strengths & Weaknesses:** \"AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than other learning algorithms. The individual learners can be weak, but as long as the performance of each one is slightly better than random guessing (e.g., their error rate is smaller than 0.5 for binary classification), the final model can be proven to converge to a strong learner.\" source ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/AdaBoost )\n",

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
