    "This capstone-project aims to solve the problem to correctly classify housenumber, extracted from Street View images. A rule-based approach (\"Look for a certain color or pattern...) is not very promising, because the house numbers look differently: They come in all colors, different fonts, sometimes they are even one underneath the other.  \n",

    "The dataset was collected by Stanford University and is described as follows: _SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images._ (from http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)\n",

    "The problem statement is to identify house numbers out of images. The images from the SVHN have been resized to a fixed resolution of 32-by-32 pixels. The file type is .mat. In addition to the images, we have the correct labels of every image.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the house number contains more then one digit (for example 123), the images are cropped. It is possible, that several digits are visible in the 32x32 image, the wanted digit is always centered. So the classifier only has to classify one digit.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason why I also chose this metric, is because it gives an easy but powerful way of calculating, how powerful and reliable the classificator will be. An important thing to analyze for using accuracy: When asking the question \"Is this image a zero?\", there is no real difference in severity of errors. False positives are as severe as false negatives. If there is no difference, using accuracy is fine (for example when classifying AIDS-tests, accuracy would be questionable).\n",

    "One technique that would be very interesting is the detection of the position of house numbers in high-resolution images. I am currently enrolled in the (Self Driving Car-Nanodegree)[https://de.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013/], where these techniques will be taught. By that, one could detect and classify house numbers in random Google Streetview images.\n",

    "The problem is often used for Machine Learning papers and there are a lot of systems, which outperform my system. Using the above mentioned AlexNet and GoogleNet, the highest result in the SHVN-dataset was achieved by (Chen-Yu Lee, Patrick W. Gallagher and Zhuowen Tu)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08985v2.pdf] with an accuracy of **98.31**. "
